**01 THE FOOL**
REVERSED: Recklessness, taken advantage of, inconsideration.

READING: You're about to feel like the namesake of this card - a fool. Be cautious of things that seem too good to be true, and try to not let yourself be walked over. 

HOBBY OF THE DAY: Try some power poses and affirmations! A wonderful one is standing in a superhero pose (feet spread, standing tall, hands on hips) in front of a mirror, and saying to yourself that you are powerful (and say that as proudly as you can)!
